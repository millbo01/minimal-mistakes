## **Clarity (Meta)**

**Tag:** Meta, Model accuracy, Truth, Learning, Understanding, Signal quality

**Definition:**

Model accuracy about reality and other actors' minds, beliefs, and intentions.

**Full Explanation:**

Clarity is the opposite of opacity. It's the degree to which an actor's model matches actual reality—accurate causation, correct predictions, reliable understanding of others' motivations and constraints.

High clarity enables effective action. You predict correctly, your interventions work, feedback confirms your model, learning accelerates. Low clarity means you're optimizing based on false beliefs—you might be working hard and making "rational" decisions, but they're rational relative to a broken model, so outcomes are consistently worse than expected.

Two types of clarity matter:

1. **Physical/causal clarity:** Do you understand how the system actually works?
2. **Social clarity:** Do you understand what others believe, want, and will do?

Most dysfunction comes from social clarity failures—you're optimizing against a model of other actors that's badly wrong. You think they're malicious (they're scared), you think they're stupid (they face constraints you don't see), you think they share your priorities (they're optimizing different tiers).

Clarity is always partial—perfect clarity is impossible. The question is: is your model accurate enough for your decisions to work? Small clarity errors in high-stakes situations produce disasters. Large clarity errors in low-stakes situations barely matter.

**Example 1 (Obvious):**

Manager believes "employees are motivated by money" (low clarity about human motivation). Tries to improve performance by offering bonuses. Employees are actually demotivated by T2 factors (feeling disrespected, no autonomy) and T5 factors (work feels meaningless). Bonuses fail to improve performance. Manager concludes "they're ungrateful" (further clarity loss). The intervention failed because manager's model of employee motivation was wrong, but opacity prevents them from discovering this—they never get clear feedback about why bonuses didn't work.

**Example 2 (Subtle):**

Parent believes child is "lazy and unmotivated" (low clarity). Reality: child has undiagnosed ADHD (different constraint set than parent's model assumes). Parent's interventions (punishment for not finishing homework, lectures about "trying harder") consistently fail and damage relationship. Child internalizes "I'm broken and disappointing." Both parent and child suffer from parent's clarity failure about what's actually happening. Not malice, not neglect—just wrong model that never gets corrected because parent interprets all evidence through the "lazy" frame.

**Common Misdiagnosis:**

Confusing confidence with clarity. People with low clarity are often highly confident—they've constructed elaborate models that feel internally consistent, but they're elaborate models of a reality that doesn't exist. High clarity often comes with appropriate uncertainty—"I think X is happening but I might be wrong, let me test it."

**Related constructs:**

→ [[Opacity]], [[Model]], [[Signal]], [[Learning]], [[Update]], [[Feedback integrity]], [[Truth-seeking]], [[Epistemics]], [[Belief]]

**Diagnostic questions:**

- Do this actor's predictions come true?
- When outcomes differ from expectations, do they update their model?
- Do they understand others' constraints and motivations?
- Are they confident about things they can't possibly know?

**Intervention principle:**

Increase clarity before attempting behavior change. Three paths:

1. **Reduce opacity:** Make relevant information visible and accessible
2. **Enable safe testing:** Let actors test their models without catastrophic costs
3. **Provide feedback:** Ensure prediction errors are visible and interpretable

Most "communication problems" are actually clarity problems—people are operating on false models and talking past each other. Fix the models, communication works automatically.
