## **Dominant Tier (Meta)**

**Tag:** Meta, Context, Incentive, Utility, Decision-making

**Definition:**

The incentive tier currently carrying the highest weight in action selection for a given actor in a given context.

**Full Explanation:**

Humans don't have a single, stable utility function. We have six competing incentive tiers, and context determines which dominates at any moment. The dominant tier is NOT the one someone talks about—it's the one that actually drives behavior when costs are real. Identifying dominant tier is the core diagnostic skill in IPF analysis.

The dominant tier shifts based on:

1. **Context cues** (workplace vs family, crisis vs stability)
2. **Perceived stakes** (high T3 threat collapses T5 concerns)
3. **Time horizon** (immediate vs delayed consequences)
4. **Individual baseline** (some people weight T2 higher by default)

Critical insight: **People often speak in T5/T6 language while operating from T2/T3/T4.** The stated reason is rarely the actual driver. Watch behavior under cost, not speeches under comfort.

Cultural context shapes baseline tier weights. Some cultures weight T2 (tribe/reputation) higher by default, others T4 (individual means), others T6 (collective stewardship). The dominant tier for a given actor reflects both the immediate context AND their cultural baseline. Same objective situation can produce different dominant tiers across cultures. (See [[Cultural Model]] for implications.)

**Example 1 (Obvious):**

Executive says company values "innovation and bold thinking" (T5 language) but fires anyone whose project fails (T3 enforcement). Dominant tier = T3 (safety). Employees correctly read the incentive and avoid risk. The stated tier is irrelevant—the dominant tier predicts behavior.

**Example 2 (Subtle):**

Parent says "I just want you to be happy" (T5) but only validates achievements that look good to relatives (T2). When child pursues unconventional path, parent's anxiety reveals T2 dominance (reputation in extended family). The child isn't confused about values—they correctly identified the dominant tier through observation of when parent experiences distress.

**Common Misdiagnosis:**

Assuming stated values = operating tier. "They said they care about X but act like Y—they're hypocrites." No—you misidentified the dominant tier. Hypocrisy is mostly incorrect diagnosis. Most people genuinely believe their stated values while unconsciously operating from different tier.

**Diagnostic method:**

1. Observe behavior under real cost
2. Identify which tier that behavior protects/serves
3. Ignore stated reasons
4. That's your dominant tier
5. Design interventions for THAT tier, not the stated one
