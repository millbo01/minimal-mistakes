## **Feedback (Meta)**

**Tag:** Meta, Learning, Information, Consequence, Signal, Update trigger

**Definition:**

Outcome information returning to actor or group after action, enabling learning and behavior correction.

**Full Explanation:**

Feedback is what closes the loop between action and learning. You do something, consequences happen, information about those consequences returns to you, you update your model or policy. Without feedback, learning is impossible—you're acting blind, unable to tell if your actions helped or hurt.

Feedback exists everywhere—every action has consequences. The question is whether feedback reaches the actor in interpretable, timely form. Most "learning failures" aren't about lack of feedback—they're about broken feedback loops where information exists but doesn't complete the circuit.

Three requirements for functional feedback:

1. **Attribution:** Can trace outcome back to action
2. **Interpretability:** Can extract meaningful signal from the information
3. **Timeliness:** Arrives before behavior becomes habit or consequences become catastrophic

When any requirement fails, you have feedback in theory but not in practice. The actor keeps doing the harmful thing because they never receive usable information about consequences.

Critical distinction: Feedback ≠ [[Feedback integrity]]. Feedback is the information flow. Integrity is whether that information actually enables learning. You can have abundant feedback with zero integrity if the signal is corrupted, delayed, or can't reach decision-makers.

**Example 1 (Obvious):**

Touching hot stove. Near-perfect feedback: immediate (consequence instant), attributable (clear cause), interpretable (pain = damage). Result: rapid learning, behavior stops after one trial. Compare to: smoking. Terrible feedback: delayed (cancer 20+ years), attribution unclear (could be genetics, environment, luck), interpretability low (no immediate pain signal). Result: minimal learning, behavior persists despite harm. Same type of harm (physical damage), completely different learning outcomes due to feedback quality.

**Example 2 (Subtle):**

Middle manager's decisions affect company performance, but feedback is corrupted at every stage. Decisions → outcomes (months delay), outcomes → metrics (aggregation hides attribution), metrics → reports (cherry-picked/spun), reports → manager (quarterly reviews). By the time any feedback arrives, it's been filtered through 4 compression/distortion steps and delayed by 6+ months. Manager can't learn what works because signal never makes it back intact. They keep making the same mistakes while thinking they're doing fine because feedback has been destroyed en route.

**Common Misdiagnosis:**

"We give lots of feedback" (performance reviews, surveys, reports) confused with functional feedback. The question isn't quantity, it's quality—does information complete the loop in usable form? Annual performance reviews are not functional feedback for daily decisions. Surveys aren't functional feedback if responses are filtered/aggregated beyond recognition.

**Diagnostic questions:**

- Does feedback about this action exist?
- Does it reach the actor who made the decision?
- Can they interpret it? (or is it buried in noise/complexity?)
- Does it arrive in time to affect future decisions?

**Intervention principle:**

Before adding more feedback channels, audit existing ones:

1. **Trace the loop:** Does information about consequences actually reach decision-makers?
2. **Check degradation:** How much signal loss happens in transmission?
3. **Measure delay:** Does feedback arrive in time to enable learning?
4. **Fix breaks first:** Repair existing loops before creating new ones

More feedback doesn't help if the loops are broken. Fix integrity before adding volume.
