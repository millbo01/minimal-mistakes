## **Context (Meta)**

**Tag:** Meta, Cue, Environment, Tier activation, Situation, Trigger

**Definition:**

Cue environment that shifts tier weighting, determining which incentives dominate in the current situation.

**Full Explanation:**

Context is what makes the same person behave completely differently in different situations. It's not that their values changed—it's that context shifted which tier carries the most weight in their optimization.

Context operates through cues—environmental signals that activate different tier priorities. See a threat → T3 (safety) dominates. See status competition → T2 (tribe) dominates. See clear path to resources → T4 (means) dominates. The person is the same, but the context determines which part of their utility function is currently in control.

This is why "character" is less stable than people think. Someone can be generous (T5-driven) in low-stakes contexts and ruthlessly selfish (T4-driven) when survival feels threatened. Both behaviors are authentic—context just changed which tier was steering.

Three context mechanisms:

1. **Threat/safety:** High threat → lower tiers dominate (T1/T2/T3)
2. **Social cues:** Presence of others → T2 activation increases
3. **Time horizon:** Short horizon → lower tiers, long horizon → higher tiers accessible

IPF's power comes from recognizing context is manipulable. Change context → change dominant tier → change behavior, without touching the person's "values" or "character" at all.

**Example 1 (Obvious):**

Same person at family dinner vs. corporate meeting. Family dinner: relaxed, jokes, admits mistakes, helps without calculating (T1/T5 context). Corporate meeting: guarded, strategic, never admits weakness, helps only when visible/advantageous (T2/T4 context). Context cues determine which optimization runs. Neither is the "real" person—both are real, just responding to different tier activation.

**Example 2 (Subtle):**

Researcher's behavior in funding crisis vs. stable funding. Stable: Takes intellectual risks, publishes negative results, collaborates openly (T5/T6 accessible). Crisis: Chases trendy topics, p-hacks borderline results, hoards data from competitors (T3/T4 dominate). Same person, same stated values ("I care about truth"), but context shifted tier dominance. Moralizing about the behavior change misses the point—context made T5/T6 optimization unsustainable, so lower tiers took over.

**Common Misdiagnosis:**

Treating context-driven behavior shifts as character inconsistency or hypocrisy. "They said they cared about X but when pressure hit they did Y." No—context shifted dominant tier, they optimized differently, this is normal and predictable. Character is less stable than we pretend.

**Related constructs:**

→ [[Dominant tier]], [[Cue]], [[Threat]], [[Safety]], [[Time horizon]], [[Salience]], [[Tier weighting]], [[Situation]]

**Diagnostic questions:**

- What cues in this environment activate which tiers?
- How does this context differ from contexts where behavior was different?
- What would need to change for different tier to dominate?
- Is "bad behavior" actually rational given context's tier activation?

**Intervention principle:**

Change context before trying to change people. If you want T5/T6 behavior (purpose, stewardship), create context where those tiers can dominate—reduce threat, extend time horizons, remove zero-sum competition. If you want compliance (T3), create contexts that activate safety concerns. Trying to inspire higher-tier motivation in lower-tier contexts is futile.
