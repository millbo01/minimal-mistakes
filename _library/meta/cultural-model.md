## **Cultural Model (Meta)**

**Tag:** Meta, Culture, Shared belief, Tier weighting, Socialization, Context

**Definition:**

Shared set of beliefs, predictions, and tier weightings learned through socialization within a population, creating default optimization landscapes that differ across cultures.

**Full Explanation:**

A cultural model is the collective version of individual model—it's what a population believes about reality, causation, morality, and which tiers matter most in which contexts. Cultural models are learned unconsciously through socialization (family, media, institutions, peer groups) and enforced through T2 mechanisms (belonging requires adopting the shared model).

Cultural models have two components:

1. **Shared beliefs:** What the culture believes about reality
    - How the world works (causation, agency, nature of humans)
    - What's "normal" vs "deviant" behavior
    - What signals respect, threat, opportunity
2. **Tier weightings:** Which incentive tiers dominate by default
    - Some cultures weight T1 (kin/family) highest across contexts
    - Others weight T2 (tribal belonging/reputation) as primary driver
    - Others weight T4 (individual means/achievement) or T6 (collective stewardship)

Cultural models are sticky—they persist across generations and resist rapid change. Individuals within a culture may deviate, but the baseline shapes everyone's default optimization. You can reject your cultural model consciously, but it still influences your automatic responses, emotional reactions, and what "feels right."

**Critical insight:** Interventions that work in one cultural context often fail in another, not because people are different but because the cultural tier landscape is different. Same incentive structure + different cultural model = different behavior.

Three ways cultural models matter for IPF:

1. **Interpretation:** Same action means different things (American casual = British rude)
2. **Tier dominance:** Same situation activates different tiers (shame in T2-heavy culture, ambition in T4-heavy)
3. **Intervention design:** Solutions must match cultural tier weights to work

Cultural models aren't better or worse—they're optimized for different historical conditions. Honor cultures (T1 dominant) evolved in environments with weak institutions and high violence. Individualist cultures (T4 dominant) emerged in contexts with strong institutions and high mobility. Collectivist cultures (T2/T6 dominant) developed where survival required tight coordination.

**Example 1 (Obvious):**

American culture vs Nordic culture on taxation. Americans: Higher T4 weighting (individual means/success) makes taxation feel like theft—taking what you earned. Nordics: Higher T6 weighting (collective stewardship) makes taxation feel like contribution—funding shared goods. Same policy, different cultural model, opposite emotional response. Neither is "wrong"—they're optimizing within different tier landscapes. Trying to import Nordic policies to US without shifting cultural tier weights produces rebellion, not welfare state.

**Example 2 (Subtle):**

Workplace feedback across cultures. Dutch culture (direct feedback = T6 honesty + low T2 face-saving) vs Japanese culture (indirect feedback = T2 harmony preservation). Dutch manager gives blunt negative feedback to Japanese employee, intending to help (T6 optimization). Japanese employee experiences it as public shaming and exclusion signal (T2 violation). Both are right within their cultural models. Neither is "more honest" or "more respectful"—they're using different tier weights to navigate the same situation. The conflict isn't personal—it's cultural models colliding.

**Common Misdiagnosis:**

Treating cultural differences as individual moral failures. "They're just rude/dishonest/lazy" when reality is "they're optimizing for different tiers within their cultural model." Also: assuming your cultural model is universal—that what works in your context will work everywhere (basis of most failed development interventions and policy transfers).

**Related constructs:**

→ [[Model]], [[Dominant tier]], [[Tier weighting]], [[Context]], [[Belief]], [[Worldview]], [[Values]], [[Morality]], [[Social proof]], [[Norm]]

**Diagnostic questions:**

- What does "success" mean in this culture? (reveals tier priorities)
- What triggers shame/pride? (reveals T2 structure)
- How is power legitimized? (reveals T4/T6 balance)
- What's considered "selfish" vs "responsible"? (reveals individualist/collectivist weighting)
- How do people describe their ideal person? (reveals valued tier balance)

**Intervention principle:**

Never design interventions assuming your cultural model is universal. Three steps:

1. **Map cultural tier weights:** Which tiers dominate in target culture for this context?
2. **Design for their landscape:** Make intervention attractive within their tier priorities, not yours
3. **Expect resistance if mismatched:** If intervention requires tier shift, it's not a "policy change"—it's a cultural transformation (decades, not years)

Fastest path: Find people within target culture whose personal tier weights already align with your intervention, empower them to translate/adapt, don't impose from outside.

**Cross-cultural failure modes:**

- **Exporting T4 individualism to T2 collectivist cultures** → Seen as selfish/destructive, rejected
- **Exporting T6 redistribution to T4 individualist cultures** → Seen as theft/tyranny, rebellion
- **Exporting T2 harmony-seeking to T6 truth-seeking cultures** → Seen as dishonest/cowardly, contempt
- **Imposing any model without understanding local tier weights** → Predictable failure

**Most "development" and "institutional reform" failures are cultural model mismatches, not corruption or incompetence.**
