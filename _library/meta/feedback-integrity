## **Feedback Integrity (Meta)**

**Tag:** Meta, Learning, Accountability, Signal, Systems Health

**Definition:**

The degree to which consequences reliably return to actors in interpretable form, enabling learning and behavior correction.

**Full Explanation:**

Feedback integrity is THE master diagnostic for system health. High integrity = consequences land on the actors who caused them, rapidly enough and clearly enough that learning occurs. Low integrity = consequences are delayed, diffused, misattributed, or hidden, preventing correction.

This is not about "good" or "bad" feedback—it's about the *connection quality* between action and outcome. A system with high feedback integrity will self-correct even with imperfect actors. A system with broken feedback integrity will accumulate dysfunction even with well-intentioned actors.

Three components required for integrity:

1. **Attribution:** Can trace outcome back to action/actor
2. **Legibility:** Outcome is interpretable (not buried in noise)
3. **Timeliness:** Feedback arrives before policy hardens

When any component fails, learning breaks. The system can't update because the signal never completes the loop.

**Example 1 (Obvious):**

Small restaurant: Chef makes bad dish → customer complains immediately → chef sees the reaction → adjusts recipe same day. High feedback integrity. Corporate chain: Chef follows recipe from HQ → customer complains to server → server logs complaint in system → complaint aggregated quarterly → HQ analyst reviews trends 6 months later → recipe already baked into supply contracts. Zero feedback integrity despite "having feedback systems."

**Example 2 (Subtle):**

Parent gives child rules with inconsistent enforcement. Sometimes violation = punishment, sometimes = nothing (depends on parent's mood, stress, who's watching). Child can't learn the actual rule because feedback is unreliable. They learn instead to track parent's emotional state and game it. This isn't the child being manipulative—it's correct adaptation to broken feedback integrity. The parent thinks they're teaching rules, but they're actually teaching "read mood and optimize."

**Common Misdiagnosis:**

"We have feedback systems" (surveys, reports, meetings) confused with feedback *integrity*. Having channels ≠ integrity. The test is: **Do actors reliably change behavior based on consequences?** If not, integrity is broken regardless of how many feedback mechanisms exist.

**Related constructs:**

→ [[Opacity]], [[Signal]], [[Noise]], [[Learning]], [[Accountability]], [[Transparency]], [[Update]], [[Reinforcement]], [[Attribution]]

**Diagnostic questions:**

- Can actors trace their actions to outcomes?
- Do consequences arrive before behavior becomes habit?
- Is the signal interpretable or buried in complexity?
- Do actors with different outcomes behave differently?

**Intervention principle:**

Before adding new policies, rules, or training, measure feedback integrity first. Most behavioral problems aren't motivation or knowledge—they're broken feedback loops. Fix the loop (reduce time lag, improve attribution, remove noise), behavior corrects automatically.
