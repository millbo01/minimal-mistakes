## **Constraint (Meta)**

**Tag:** Meta, Limits, Option set, Resources, Structure, Feasibility

**Definition:**

Limits on available options, resources, permissions, capabilities, or energy that bound what actions are possible regardless of preferences.

**Full Explanation:**

Constraints are what make behavior analysis possible. If actors had unlimited options and resources, predicting behavior would be impossible—too many paths available. Constraints narrow the feasible set, making optimization tractable. Understanding which constraints bind (are actively limiting) reveals what the actor can actually do vs. what they might prefer.

Three types:

1. **Resource constraints:** Time, money, energy, attention (T4 scarcity)
2. **Capability constraints:** Knowledge, skills, physical ability (what actor can do)
3. **Permission constraints:** Rules, norms, power structures (what actor is allowed to do)

Critical insight: **Actors optimize within constraints, not against them.** When behavior seems suboptimal, ask: what constraints make the "better" option infeasible? Often what looks like poor choice is actually optimal given invisible constraints the observer doesn't see.

Constraints shift constantly. Under stress (T3 activation), time horizon shortens and risk tolerance drops—this effectively adds constraints that didn't exist in calm conditions. Under resource abundance, constraints relax and different behaviors become possible.

**Example 1 (Obvious):**

Single parent working two jobs. Observer: "Why don't they meal prep healthy food instead of feeding kids fast food? That's irresponsible." But constraints: (1) Time—12 hour workdays leave 2 hours between getting home and kids' bedtime, (2) Energy—exhausted after physical labor, no cognitive bandwidth for planning/cooking, (3) Money—healthy ingredients cost more than dollar menu. Given these constraints, fast food is locally rational—meets calorie needs with minimal time/energy/money expenditure. The "better" option isn't actually available.

**Example 2 (Subtle):**

Junior employee sees obvious inefficiency in workflow. Doesn't speak up. Observer: "They don't care about quality" or "They're not a team player." But constraints: (1) Permission—company culture punishes challenges from junior staff (T2/T3 risk), (2) Knowledge—they don't know if they're seeing the full picture or missing crucial context, (3) Political capital—previous person who raised similar issue was sidelined. Given these constraints, silence is rational even though inefficiency persists. The "right thing to do" carries costs the observer doesn't face.

**Common Misdiagnosis:**

Attributing constraint-limited behavior to motivation failure. "They're lazy/don't care/aren't trying" when reality is "they lack the resources/permission/capability to do the preferred action." This leads to useless interventions (motivational speeches, exhortations to "try harder") instead of constraint removal.

**Related constructs:**

→ [[Option set]], [[Resources]], [[Capability]], [[Power]], [[Local rationality]], [[Revealed preference]], [[Opportunity cost]], [[Agency]]

**Diagnostic questions:**

- What does actor say they'd do if constraints were removed?
- What resources/permissions/capabilities are missing?
- Are constraints real or perceived? (matters for intervention)
- Which constraint binds most tightly? (remove that one first)

**Intervention principle:**

Before judging behavior, map constraints. Three paths:

1. **Remove constraint:** Give resources, permission, training
2. **Work within constraint:** Find better option that fits existing limits
3. **Accept constraint:** Recognize some behaviors are infeasible and adjust expectations

Trying to change behavior without addressing binding constraints is futile. The actor is already optimizing—just within limits you're not seeing.
