## **Model (Meta)**

**Tag:** Meta, Belief, Prediction, Compression, Learning, Reality-mapping

**Definition:**

Compressed internal representation of reality used to predict outcomes, evaluate options, and guide behavior.

**Full Explanation:**

A model is how an actor represents the world internally—what they believe about causation, probability, other actors' intentions, and consequences. Models are always compressed (you can't hold full reality in your head) and always contain errors. The critical questions are: (1) How wrong is the model? (2) Does it update when predictions fail?

Models operate mostly unconsciously. People aren't aware they're using simplified representations—they experience their model as "reality." This is why two people in identical situations can behave completely differently: they're operating on different models, making different predictions about what will happen.

Key characteristics:

1. **Compression:** Models drop detail to be manageable (lossy process)
2. **Prediction:** Used to forecast outcomes before action
3. **Update-resistance:** Models protected by identity (T2) and safety (T3) concerns
4. **Contagion:** Models spread socially, creating shared reality within groups

IPF's core insight: Most "irrational" behavior is rational given the actor's model. The error isn't in their optimization—it's in their model of reality. Fix the model (provide clarity, reduce opacity), behavior corrects automatically.

Critical clarification: The model is part of the effective incentive structure, not separate from it. When IPF claims 'same incentive structure produces same behavior,' this means [Structure + Model] → Behavior. Two actors facing identical objective circumstances but holding different models are NOT in the same effective incentive structure—their perceived payoffs differ, so their optimization differs. This isn't a limitation of IPF determinism—it's a specification of what 'incentive structure' actually includes. Change either the objective structure OR the actor's model, and behavior changes predictably.

**Example 1 (Obvious):**

Manager believes "employees only work when monitored closely" (model). This model predicts: autonomy → slacking → poor performance. Manager implements micromanagement and surveillance. Employees respond to mistrust by reducing intrinsic motivation and doing minimum required (correct prediction given the manager's behavior). Manager's model is confirmed: "See, they do slack when I'm not watching." The model is self-fulfilling—it generates the reality it predicts, preventing update. Manager doesn't realize their behavior caused the outcome.

**Example 2 (Subtle):**

Person with childhood abuse history develops model: "Expressing needs = punishment and abandonment" (formed when true). As adult, they enter healthy relationship but operate on old model. They suppress needs, never ask for help, anticipate rejection that isn't coming. Partner gets confused by distance and lack of communication, starts withdrawing (providing space). Person's model predicts this: "I knew expressing needs would drive them away." The model is directing behavior that generates confirming evidence even though the model is outdated. Without intervention, model never updates because it's self-sealing.

**Common Misdiagnosis:**

Treating model errors as stupidity or ignorance rather than recognizing models are self-reinforcing and update-resistant. "Just show them the facts" fails because facts get filtered through existing model. Until model structure changes, contradictory evidence gets rationalized away or ignored.

**Related constructs:**

→ [[Clarity]], [[Opacity]], [[Belief]], [[Update]], [[Learning]], [[Prediction]], [[Local rationality]], [[Cognitive dissonance]], [[Confirmation bias]], [[Worldview]]

**Diagnostic questions:**

- What does actor believe will happen if they take action X?
- Where did that belief come from? (experience, social learning, authority?)
- Has the model been tested against reality recently?
- What evidence would update this model? Is that evidence accessible?

**Intervention principle:**

Behavior change requires model change. Three paths:

1. **Provide clarity:** Give actor better information (only works if model isn't identity-protected)
2. **Forced update:** Create prediction failure so severe model can't rationalize it away
3. **Gradual testing:** Enable safe experiments that generate disconfirming evidence

Never argue directly with someone's model—their behavior makes sense within it. Either change the model or change which model-predictions dominate their optimization.
