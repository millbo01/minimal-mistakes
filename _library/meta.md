## Understanding Meta Concepts

Meta concepts are the foundational mechanisms that operate across all incentive tiers. These are your diagnostic tools—the lens through which you analyze behavior, systems, and dysfunction.

**Start here if you're new to the framework.** Understanding these terms gives you the ability to:
- Identify which tier is actually driving behavior (not just what people say)
- Diagnose why systems persistently fail despite good intentions
- Predict how actors will respond to incentive changes
- Design interventions that actually work

## Core Diagnostic Primitives

These terms form the foundation of all IPF analysis:

### [Incentive](/library/meta/incentive/)
Anything that shifts expected payoff in the currently dominant tier. The core unit of IPF—everything else exists to help you identify what incentives actually exist and how strong they are.

### [Dominant Tier](/library/meta/dominant-tier/)
The incentive tier currently carrying the highest weight in action selection. This is what's *actually* driving behavior, not what people say matters.

### [Context](/library/meta/context/)
The cue environment that shifts tier weighting, determining which incentives dominate. Change context → change dominant tier → change behavior.

### [Local Rationality](/library/meta/local-rationality/)
Behavior is optimal relative to the actor's model, tier weights, and constraints—even when it appears destructive. There are no irrational actors, only incomplete models of their incentives.

## Information & Learning

How actors update (or fail to update) their models:

### [Clarity](/library/meta/clarity/)
Model accuracy about reality and other actors' minds, beliefs, and intentions. High clarity enables effective action.

### [Opacity](/library/meta/opacity/)
Model loss, distortion, or misattribution that prevents accurate understanding. The master mechanism enabling misalignment.

### [Signal](/library/meta/signal/)
Input that carries information capable of updating beliefs or policies about reality.

### [Noise](/library/meta/noise/)
Input that degrades belief accuracy or obscures signal without carrying useful information.

### [Feedback](/library/meta/feedback/)
Outcome information returning to actor after action, enabling learning and behavior correction.

### [Feedback Integrity](/library/meta/feedback-integrity/)
The degree to which consequences reliably return to actors in interpretable form. THE master diagnostic for system health.

## Decision Architecture

How actors perceive options and make choices:

### [Constraint](/library/meta/constraint/)
Limits on available options, resources, or capabilities that bound what actions are possible regardless of preferences.
