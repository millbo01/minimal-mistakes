## Understanding the Framework Language

The Library contains all terms and concepts used throughout Adaptive Systems Theory. Each term is tagged with its primary tier or marked as Meta (foundational mechanism that operates across tiers).

### How to Use This Library

**Start with Meta Concepts** if you're new to the framework. These are the diagnostic tools—the lens through which you analyze behavior and systems. Understanding terms like *Incentive*, *Dominant Tier*, *Opacity*, and *Local Rationality* gives you the foundation for everything else.

**Then explore tier-specific terms** based on what you're trying to understand:
- Analyzing organizational dysfunction? → Safety & Means (T3/T4)
- Understanding social dynamics? → Kin & Tribe (T1/T2)
- Diagnosing mission drift? → Meaning & Stewardship (T5/T6)

### Reading the Tags

Each term includes a **tier tag** that tells you which incentive tier it primarily serves, protects, or threatens.

**Tier Tags:**
- **T1 (Kin):** Genetic continuity, family, small-group survival
- **T2 (Tribe):** Belonging, reputation, social cohesion
- **T3 (Safety):** Stability, risk avoidance, predictability
- **T4 (Means):** Resources, proxies, optimization for future options
- **T5 (Meaning):** Purpose, legacy, long-term coherence
- **T6 (Stewardship):** Principle, systems integrity, collective flourishing
- **Meta:** Mechanisms operating across tiers (feedback, learning, model quality)

**Important:** Tags indicate the tier the term *operates in*, not necessarily the language people use to describe it. People often speak in T5/T6 language ("values," "purpose," "doing the right thing") while their behavior reveals T2/T3/T4 optimization. Watch behavior under cost, not speeches under comfort.

### Common Interpretation Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Assuming stated tier = operating tier**

When someone says "I care about truth" (T6 language) but never updates their beliefs when evidence contradicts them, they're not hypocrites—they're operating from a different tier (likely T2: maintaining tribal belonging). The tag shows the *actual* tier driving behavior.

**Example:** *Morality* is often **T2** (tribal enforcement and signaling) even though people experience it as T5/T6 (purpose/principle). Only when someone sacrifices lower-tier rewards for moral consistency is it genuinely operating at T5/T6.

**Mistake 2: Treating tier as fixed character trait**

Tiers aren't personality types. The same person operates from different tiers depending on context. High threat → T3 dominates. Safe environment + long time horizon → T5/T6 accessible. The tier tag shows where the term *typically* operates, not where it *always* operates.

**Example:** *Risk avoidance* (T3) looks like "being careful" in one context, "cowardice" in another, "wisdom" in a third. The tier doesn't change—the judgment does.

**Mistake 3: Moralizing tier hierarchy**

Higher tiers aren't "better" and lower tiers aren't "worse." They're optimization strategies for different conditions. T1 (kin protection) kept humans alive for millennia. T3 (safety) prevents catastrophic errors. T4 (means) enables long-term planning. Each tier is adaptive in its proper context.

**Example:** Calling someone "selfish" (T4 optimization) misses that they might face constraints you don't see. Calling someone "naive idealist" (T5 optimization) misses that they have safety you lack. The diagnostic question isn't "which tier is better?" but "which tier is dominant, and why?"

### How Terms Connect

Terms in this library form a **causal network**. Understanding one term often requires understanding several others:

- *Incentive* → *Dominant Tier* → *Local Rationality*  
  (What shifts payoffs → What's being optimized → Why behavior makes sense)

- *Opacity* → *Feedback Integrity* → *Learning*  
  (What breaks signal → Whether consequences land → Whether actors update)

- *Model* → *Narrative* → *Update Resistance*  
  (Internal representation → Story protecting identity → Why change is hard)

Follow the **"Related constructs"** links in each term to trace these connections.

### Navigation

The library is organized by conceptual grouping:

**[Meta Concepts](/library/meta/)** - Foundational diagnostic mechanisms  
**[Behavior & Choice](/library/autonomy-and-behavior/)** - Agency, habit, impulse, addiction  
**[Kin & Tribe (T1/T2)](/library/kin-and-tribe/)** - Belonging, reputation, loyalty, shame  
**[Safety & Means (T3/T4)](/library/safety-and-means/)** - Risk, resources, proxies, Goodharting  
**[Meaning & Stewardship (T5/T6)](/library/meaning-and-stewardship/)** - Purpose, integrity, governance  
**[Morality & Values](/library/morality-and-values/)** - Ethics, revealed preference, beliefs  
**[Power & Manipulation](/library/power-and-manipulation/)** - Coercion, leverage, impunity  
**[Accountability & Enforcement](/library/accountability-and-enforcement/)** - Justice, punishment, theatre  
**[Trust & Cooperation](/library/trust-and-cooperation/)** - Coordination, collective action  
**[Conflict & Polarization](/library/conflict-and-polarization/)** - Tribalism, dehumanization, echo chambers  
**[Communication & Distance](/library/communication-and-distance/)** - Abstraction, psychological distance  
**[Organizations & Institutions](/library/organizations-and-institutions/)** - Bureaucracy, drift, resistance  
**[Harm & Externalities](/library/harm-and-externalities/)** - Cost displacement, exploitation, cruelty

## Start Exploring

**New to the framework?** Start with [Incentive](/library/meta/incentive/), then [Dominant Tier](/library/meta/dominant-tier/), then [Local Rationality](/library/meta/local-rationality/).

**Diagnosing a specific problem?** Jump to the tier you think is dominant and explore related terms.

**Building depth?** Read Meta Concepts sequentially—they form the complete diagnostic toolkit.
