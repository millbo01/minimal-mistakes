## The Method

This framework wasn't built in a laboratory or derived from academic theory. It was built by working backwards from patterns that don't fit conventional explanations.

### The Pattern Recognition Approach

Most theories start with assumptions and try to fit reality to them. This framework does the opposite:

1. **Observe** - What patterns exist that current models can't explain?
2. **Question** - What if the "explanation" is backwards?
3. **Test** - Does the alternative model predict better than the standard one?
4. **Refine** - Adjust based on evidence, not ideology

### What This Framework Explains

Adaptive Systems Theory (AST) provides a unified explanation for patterns across:

- **Human behavior** - Why people excel in some contexts but struggle in others
- **Social structures** - How incentive systems shape entire populations
- **Evolutionary biology** - Adaptive variation vs pathology
- **Organizational dynamics** - Why systems resist change even when failing
- **Historical cycles** - Repeating patterns of rise, stagnation, collapse

### The Core Insight

**Context determines function.** 

What appears as "dysfunction" in one environment may be optimization for a different set of conditions. The error isn't in the individual - it's in the mismatch between design and deployment.
