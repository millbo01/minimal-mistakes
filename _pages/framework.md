## The Complete System

Adaptive Systems Theory rests on three foundational frameworks. Each explains a different dimension of human behavior and social organization. **None works in isolation** - the power comes from their integration.

### The Three Pillars

#### 1. Incentive Primacy Framework (IPF)
**Structure determines behavior**

Most people believe individuals make choices based on values, then build structures around those choices. IPF inverts this: **structures create the incentives that define what counts as rational, virtuous, and true.**

The same person in different incentive structures will exhibit completely different behavior - not because their values changed, but because the structure redefined what "rational" means.

#### 2. Natural Role Theory (NRT)
**Adaptive variation, not pathology**

Humans exhibit behavioral variation not as random diversity or disorder, but as **adaptive responses to different environmental pressures**. What modern psychology labels as "pathology" may be optimization for conditions that differ from current societal norms.

NRT explains why certain traits cluster, why they run in families, and why rates are rising.

#### 3. Six Needs Framework (6NF)
**Natural vs artificial fulfillment**

Humans have six core needs. Modern systems offer artificial substitutes that satisfy the need signal without providing genuine fulfillment. This creates a trap: the need appears met (reducing motivation to seek real fulfillment) while remaining fundamentally unsatisfied.

Understanding which needs are being artificially vs naturally met explains patterns of dissatisfaction despite material abundance.

## Why Three Pillars?

**Each pillar alone is incomplete:**

- **IPF alone** explains behavior within structures but doesn't explain *individual variation* or *why some people resist structural incentives*
- **NRT alone** explains individual differences but doesn't explain *how structures amplify or suppress certain roles*
- **6NF alone** explains dissatisfaction but doesn't explain *how systems systematically create artificial substitutes*

**Together, they form a complete picture:**

1. **Structures create incentives** (IPF) that reward certain behaviors
2. **Different role types** (NRT) respond to those incentives differently based on their adaptive optimization
3. **Artificial need fulfillment** (6NF) keeps people trapped in maladaptive systems by satisfying need signals without genuine fulfillment

### Integration Example: Modern Work

- **IPF:** Corporate structures reward compliance and punish deviation (quarterly metrics, promotion systems, performance reviews)
- **NRT:** Guardian types thrive in this structure (comfort with norms, stability-seeking). Scout types struggle (novelty-deprived, threat from routine)
- **6NF:** Work provides artificial fulfillment (status symbols, team bonding events, "purpose" statements) that satisfies need signals without genuine meaning

**Result:** Guardians remain in dysfunctional systems longer because structure + artificial fulfillment create stable trap. Scouts exit or burn out faster because mismatch is intolerable despite artificial rewards.

## What This Means

If you understand only IPF, you'll try to fix structures but wonder why some people still fail in "good" systems.

If you understand only NRT, you'll recognize your type but feel powerless against structures that punish your optimization.

If you understand only 6NF, you'll avoid artificial substitutes but struggle to understand why systems persist in offering them.

**Understanding all three gives you:**
- **Diagnostic power** - Identify why systems fail and who suffers most
- **Predictive power** - Anticipate structural evolution and individual responses  
- **Strategic power** - Position yourself (or design systems) to align incentives, roles, and genuine needs
