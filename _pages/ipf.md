## People Respond to What Pays

Most explanations of human behavior start with individual psychology—values, character, motivation, intelligence. IPF inverts this: **the structure of incentives determines behavior far more powerfully than individual traits.**

Put the same person in different incentive structures, you get radically different behavior. Change the structure, behavior changes predictably—without touching the person's "values" or "character" at all. Same human, different structure = different behavior. Structure doesn't just constrain behavior—it redefines what counts as rational, virtuous, and true.

Here "pays" means anything the nervous system treats as net-positive expected value across the tiers: social reward, risk reduction, identity protection, belonging, meaning—not just money.

## The Core Insight

**Incentive structures don't just influence behavior—they're primary.** They define what counts as rational within any given structure, and they do so with enough consistency that outcomes become predictable once you map them correctly.

Values, temperament, intelligence, culture, and history still matter, but they function as parameters shaping how incentives are perceived and weighted, not as independent causes that float free of consequence.

**Most incentive processing is not conscious.** People don't sit and compute tiers. The nervous system continuously estimates payoffs—safety, belonging, reputational risk, effort, uncertainty, relief. What we experience as "a choice" is often the final output of that weighting, followed by a story that makes the behavior legible to ourselves and others.

**Free will, as traditionally conceived, is largely illusory.** Not because people are robots, but because the "will" is mostly the felt experience of an autonomic valuation process choosing among constrained options, given learned priors and perceived payoffs. The freedom people actually have is real, but it exists inside the incentive terrain, not outside it.

## What IPF Explains

IPF provides a unified framework for understanding:

- **Why good people produce bad outcomes** - Misaligned incentives, not bad character
- **Why organizations drift from stated missions** - Proxy metrics capture optimization
- **Why reform attempts repeatedly fail** - Treating symptoms, not structural causes
- **Why the same problems recur across domains** - Shared incentive patterns
- **Why consequences don't land on those who caused them** - Opacity breaks feedback loops
- **Why societies collapse despite material abundance** - Tier-2 dominance creates structural blindness

The framework makes previously mysterious patterns predictable and addressable—once you see the incentive structure clearly.

## Three Foundational Principles

### 1. Local Rationality

**Every actor is optimizing correctly given their model, tier weights, and constraints.**

What looks irrational is actually a failure of the observer to model the actor's subjective incentive structure accurately. Most actions are locally rational relative to the weighted incentive environment at the moment of decision, even when they are globally self-defeating in hindsight.

When behavior seems irrational, ask: "What model and weights make this behavior optimal?" The answer reveals the intervention point. The failure isn't in the actor's optimization—it's in the structure that makes the wrong thing optimal.

→ [Explore Local Rationality in the Library](/library/meta/local-rationality/)

### 2. The Two-Factor Model: Incentives × Opacity

**Incentives don't operate in isolation. Their behavioral force is shaped by the degree of opacity in the system.**

When incentives are aligned and consequences are transparent, cooperation and truth-seeking become rational. When incentives are misaligned and consequences are obscured, exploitation and dysfunction become rational.

Opacity is a force multiplier. It modulates the payoff landscape by obscuring risks and externalities. Three mechanisms break feedback:

- **Diffused attribution** - Can't trace outcome to specific actor
- **Temporal delay** - Consequences arrive too late to update behavior  
- **Displaced costs** - Benefits accrue to actor, costs fall on others

When feedback integrity breaks, local optimization systematically produces global harm—not because actors are evil, but because their optimization doesn't include costs they don't experience.

→ [Explore Opacity in the Library](/library/meta/opacity/)  
→ [Explore Feedback Integrity in the Library](/library/meta/feedback-integrity/)

### 3. Dominant Tier Predicts Behavior

**Context determines which of six incentive tiers carries the most weight right now.**

Humans don't have single, stable utility functions. We have competing tiers that activate based on context. The tier currently dominant determines what gets optimized. Change context → change dominant tier → change behavior.

Lower tiers (T1-T4) dominate under threat and scarcity. Higher tiers (T5-T6) become accessible only when lower tiers feel secure. Most institutional dysfunction comes from mistaking which tier is actually dominant.

→ [Explore Dominant Tier in the Library](/library/meta/dominant-tier/)

## The Six Tiers of Incentive Dominance

Not all incentives carry equal weight. Humans weight incentives according to perceived survival, identity, and stability value. These tiers are not beliefs people explicitly endorse—they are dominant weighting regimes that activate under different perceived conditions.

| Tier | Core Drive | When It Dominates | Example Optimization |
|------|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| **T1: Kin** | Genetic continuity, family survival | Family threat, offspring at risk | Nepotism, protecting children above all else |
| **T2: Tribe** | Belonging, reputation, social status | Social evaluation present, survival secured | Conforming to avoid exclusion, status competition |
| **T3: Safety** | Stability, risk avoidance, predictability | Threat perceived, uncertainty high | Choosing known-bad over unknown, whistleblower suppression |
| **T4: Means** | Resources, proxies, future optionality | Scarcity, competition for position | Optimizing wealth/credentials, career advancement |
| **T5: Meaning** | Purpose, legacy, coherent narrative | Safety secure, long time horizon | Sacrificing comfort for mission, innovation |
| **T6: Stewardship** | Systems integrity, collective flourishing | Principles tested under cost | Accepting personal loss for structural health |

### Why Tier 4 (Means) Appears Universal

Resources function as a conversion mechanism, not as terminal goals. People don't pursue money for its own sake—they pursue what money converts into within their dominant tier.

- For someone operating from kinship incentives (T1): Resources = security and continuity
- For someone driven by belonging (T2): Resources = proof of worth and status signals
- For someone focused on purpose (T5): Resources = freedom to experiment or sustain principles

Because this tier serves every other tier, it appears universally motivating. This creates the illusion that financial incentives are primary—which explains why economic policy focuses almost exclusively on them, and why they consistently fail to produce predicted outcomes when deeper incentives are misaligned.

### Cultural Modulation

The tier structure itself appears universal, but the relative weighting and activation thresholds vary by culture. Collectivist cultures consistently weight belonging (T2) over economic gain (T4). High power-distance cultures maintain stability (T3) as dominant even when reform pressures build. Individualist or post-materialist cultures activate purpose (T5) and transcendence (T6) earlier because baseline survival needs are more secure.

This doesn't undermine the framework—it enhances it. Cultural variance is an input into incentive weighting, not an exception to incentive causality.

## Three Systemic Equilibria

Incentive structures don't just shape individual behavior—they determine the equilibrium state of entire societies over time. Systems evolve toward outcomes that get rewarded and away from those that get penalized or made inefficient.

Historical patterns and systems theory indicate three primary trajectories:

### Fragmentation Equilibrium

**Incentives reward:** Competition between groups, short-term gain, identity reinforcement, localized signaling

**Result:** Social cohesion declines as individuals optimize for in-group status. Truth becomes secondary to narrative advantage. Institutions lose legitimacy. Trust erodes, leading to disengagement or unrest.

**Examples:** Tragedy of the commons, late Roman Republic, Yugoslav breakup, social media-driven polarization

**Outcome:** Rational self-interest produces collective incoherence.

### Centralization Equilibrium

**Incentives reward:** Stability, obedience, suppression of conflict in exchange for security

**Result:** Order maintained through top-down control. Dissent is disincentivized. Transparency flows upward but not outward. Efficiency prioritized over plurality.

**Examples:** Hobbes' Leviathan, wartime executive centralization, planned economies, digital authoritarian models

**Outcome:** Stability achieved, but adaptive capacity and personal agency decline.

### Positive-Sum Equilibrium

**Incentives reward:** Cooperation, truth, innovation, and long-term stability by making aligned behavior the most advantageous strategy

**Result:** Transparency reduces viability of exploitative strategies. Institutions gain legitimacy through visible accountability. Individuals benefit materially and reputationally from pro-social behavior. Collective trust sustained not by ideology but by rational alignment.

**Examples:** Elinor Ostrom's commons governance research, high-trust democratic models, distributed ledger systems with economic security

**Outcome:** Rational self-interest produces positive-sum outcomes and sustained stability.

## The Tier-2 Trap: Why Secure Societies Fragment

When societies successfully meet basic survival needs—through wealth redistribution, entertainment infrastructure, or military protection—a counterintuitive shift occurs. **The population doesn't become more resistant to elite extraction. It becomes more vulnerable to it.**

### The Mechanism

Once survival needs are reliably met, they recede as the dominant tier. In their place, social belonging, status, and ideological alignment rise to dominance (Tier 2). The population's attention shifts from material security to social positioning.

This produces three behavioral consequences:

**1. Tribal Fragmentation**  
With survival secured, citizens redirect competitive energy toward:
- Status hierarchies within subgroups
- Ideological purity contests
- Performative belonging displays
- Sectarian conflict over symbolic issues

The population fractures into competing tribal identities, each optimizing for in-group status rather than collective material interests.

**2. Elite Extraction Proceeds Unchallenged**  
While the population engages in status warfare:
- Economic inequality expands
- Institutional capture deepens
- Transparency mechanisms erode

The very security that freed citizens from survival concerns creates blindness to resource exploitation.

**3. Manufactured Conflicts**  
Elites—whether consciously or through structural incentive—amplify divisions:
- Media promotes tribal narratives (engagement generates revenue)
- Political parties weaponize identity (voter mobilization)
- Institutions signal tribal allegiance (career advancement requires conformity)

What appears as organic cultural conflict is often optimization responding to institutionally-generated incentives.

### Historical Parallels

**Late Roman Empire:** Bread and circuses secured basic needs while the population fractured into circus factions rioting over sports teams. Senate extraction continued through land consolidation. Empire collapsed from internal division while elites hoarded wealth.

**Late Soviet Union:** Employment, housing, and food rations guaranteed. Population optimized for Party membership and ideological conformity. Factional conflicts emerged. The nomenklatura accelerated extraction. Collapse came not from starvation but from legitimacy crisis.

**Contemporary Western Democracies:** Welfare states secure baseline survival. Population fragments along tribal lines (political tribalism, identity politics, culture wars). Elite extraction expands (historic wealth inequality, institutional capture). Discourse dominated by symbolic conflicts while material extraction continues.

### The Prediction

Any society that secures basic needs without structural safeguards against resource extraction will experience:
- Rising tribal conflict as dominant tier shifts
- Accelerating elite extraction as population attention diverts
- Eventual legitimacy collapse when tribal conflicts erode institutional trust faster than material security can compensate

**The intervention implication:** Transparency mechanisms must be implemented before or during the expansion of material security, not after tribal dominance establishes. Once tribal fragmentation becomes the dominant social dynamic, coordinated reform becomes structurally difficult.

## Common Misdiagnoses IPF Corrects

| Common Diagnosis | IPF Reframe | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| "They're hypocrites" | Different tier dominates under cost vs comfort | Stop moralizing, fix structure |
| "They don't care" | Wrong tier targeted by intervention | Design for actual dominant tier |
| "Incentives are aligned" | You're targeting wrong tier or missing opacity | Trace actual payoffs, not stated ones |
| "People are irrational" | Your model of their incentives is incomplete | Assume local rationality, find what you're missing |
| "We need better people" | Structure makes current behavior optimal | Change structure, not personnel |
| "It's a moral failure" | Structure made the immoral thing rational | Responsibility relocates to terrain design |

**Morality is often post-hoc rationalization.** Not in the sense that ethics are fake, but in the sense that humans frequently use moral language to narrate and justify behaviors that were selected by incentives first. Moral stories help coordinate groups and preserve identity, but they are a weak tool for predicting behavior under pressure.

---

## How to Use IPF: The Diagnostic Method

### Step 1: Map the Actors
Identify all relevant participants—individuals, institutions, regulators, investors, consumers, media. Determine what each actor can do.

### Step 2: Identify Reward and Consequence Structures
For each actor, document:
- What gets rewarded (financial gain, status, certainty, belonging, risk avoidance, legacy)
- What gets penalized (loss of access, reputation damage, career risk, regulatory exposure)
- Whether incentives are explicit (bonuses, legislation) or implicit (social approval, career stability)

### Step 3: Determine Incentive Weighting
Analyze how incentives weight according to:
- Time horizon (short-term vs long-term rewards)
- Certainty (guaranteed vs probabilistic outcomes)
- Identity and belonging (alignment with group norms)
- Risk exposure (personal vs externalized consequences)

The strongest weighted incentives will determine behavior regardless of stated values or institutional mission statements.

### Step 4: Identify Active Tiers
Determine which tier currently dominates for each actor. This reveals:
- Which incentives currently drive action
- Which latent incentives could be activated through structural intervention
- Which incentives must be weakened or flipped to realign behaviors

### Step 5: Predict Equilibrium Outcomes
Based on incentive weighting and active tiers:
- Which behaviors are rational for each actor to adopt?
- Which behaviors are irrational and thus unlikely to persist?
- Where do incentives between actors conflict or align?
- Does the system trend toward fragmentation, centralization, or positive-sum alignment?

### Step 6: Identify Leverage Points
Locate strategic nodes where small incentive adjustments or transparency interventions will cascade across the system and shift the equilibrium trajectory.

**Systemic change isn't achieved by persuading individuals to behave differently. It's achieved by making different behavior rational.**

## Transparency as Structural Correction

Transparency restores consequence to the incentive landscape. It's a feedback mechanism, not a moral intervention. When cause and effect become visible, the cost of deception rises and the benefit of integrity increases.

### Why Opacity Enables Dysfunction

Misalignment persists when consequences are invisible, delayed, or externalized. Actors can extract value, transfer risk, or distort information without bearing proportional cost because the connection between action and outcome stays hidden.

Opacity becomes self-reinforcing. The very structure that enables exploitation also makes it rational to preserve that structure.

### How Transparency Corrects

When consequences become observable, three things happen simultaneously:

1. **Cost of misaligned behavior increases** - Actions profitable under opacity become costly under scrutiny
2. **Benefit of aligned behavior increases** - Trust, legitimacy, and stability become tangible advantages  
3. **The calculation changes for everyone** - What was rational under opacity becomes irrational under transparency

This isn't about changing human nature. It's about changing the payoff matrix.

### Strategic vs Total Transparency

Total transparency creates its own pathologies—constant surveillance produces performative behavior, innovation gets suppressed, privacy violations enable harassment.

The framework calls for **strategic transparency**: disclosure targeted where opacity breeds systemic leverage. Funding flows that create hidden dependencies. Decision criteria that determine resource allocation. Conflicts of interest that compromise institutional integrity.

These are the nodes where hidden information enables extraction. Making them visible changes the incentive landscape without creating surveillance infrastructure.

### Reflexive Transparency

Any system designed to restore incentive alignment must itself remain subject to transparency and accountability. Designers and operators of such systems must be held to the same or higher standards of scrutiny as those they observe.

Without self-auditing architecture, even corrective systems risk becoming captured by the very incentive distortions they're designed to neutralize.

## Historical Validation: The Protestant Reformation

The Protestant Reformation demonstrates the first large-scale case of incentive transparency destabilizing a dominant control structure.

When printing technology made scripture accessible, the Catholic Church's monopoly on biblical interpretation collapsed. Indulgence sales—where paying money supposedly reduced time in purgatory—became visible as an extraction mechanism rather than divine doctrine.

Once the incentive structure became transparent, legitimacy eroded rapidly. This wasn't theological victory but structural inevitability once opacity disappeared.

The same pattern repeats: Visibility breaks misalignment. Not through moral conversion, but through making exploitation inefficient.

→ [Deep dive: Applications & Backtests](/framework/ipf/applications/)

---

## Falsification Criteria

For intellectual integrity, the framework defines conditions under which it would be considered invalidated:

1. **If two independent observers with full access to the same incentive map disagree irreconcilably on predicted outcomes**
2. **If a system consistently produces behaviors that contradict predicted tier dominance without observable incentive change**
3. **If predictive accuracy doesn't outperform probabilistic or behavioral models over time**

The framework makes forward predictions based on dominance of observable incentive structures. If predictions consistently fail, the framework should be revised or abandoned.

The framework's credibility depends not on ideological certainty but on continuous testing against empirical evidence.
